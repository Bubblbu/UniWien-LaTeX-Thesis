# UniWien-LaTeX-Thesis
An unofficial LaTeX template for a Master's Thesis at the University of Vienna (Universit√§t Wien). I meets the [requirements](https://ssc-sozialwissenschaften.univie.ac.at/formulare/for-prref/) for the design of the first page.

You need to edit *main.tex* file to insert:

- all your personal details (name, title, program),
- abstracts,
- CV details,
- specify *.tex* files with the actual content of the thesis (in this template, these are *ch1.tex*, *ch2.tex*, and *ch3.tex*).

All places where your data needs to be inserted are indicated by comments.

Make sure that your default bibliography tool is set to *biber*.
